            <h2>Why I Love Her So Much?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I love the way he sings and perform on stage. She is also very kind to people and have a beautiful
                perspective in life despite the problems that she encountered. She is also a great actress. I started to
                admire him since he was on the 1990 American TV-series <em>Barney and Friends</em>. I also watch her MYX
                music video <em>Come and Get it</em> when I was younger. I love her and her music. This is my tribute
                page to her so that I always keep motivated by doing what I love because of her. I love you always
                Selena Gomez! ❤❤❤</p>
